# GoAPI
In this repository, you can check my first application using this fantastic language call by GOOO! 

This is an application that performs two activities:
1 - Search the public IP of a specific host
2 - Search the name of the server on which the host is hosted

If you have GO installed on your machine, just run the binary file linha-de-comando.exe at your cmd
follows command example

./linha-de-comando ip --host github.com     

or 

./linha-de-comando servidores --host github.com
